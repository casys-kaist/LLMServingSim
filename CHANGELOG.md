## [v1.0.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Multi-instance simulation with configurable request routing policies (Round Robin, Random, Custom)
- Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregation support across instances
- Mixture of Experts (MoE) support with expert parallelism, expert offloading, and configurable
  routing policies (Round Robin, Random, Fast, Custom)
- Prefix caching using RadixAttention (based on SGLang), with support for second-tier prefix cache
  pooling across CPU and CXL memory (`--enable-prefix-caching`, `--enable-prefix-sharing`)
- Sub-batch interleaving to overlap prefill and decode phases within an iteration
  (`--enable-sub-batch-interleaving`)
- Attention latency predictor using scikit-learn for real-time per-request estimation
  (`--enable-attn-prediction`)
- Power and energy modeling per node covering NPU, CPU, DRAM, interconnect, NIC, and storage
- CXL memory expansion support with configurable bandwidth and latency
- Enhanced PIM (Processing-In-Memory) model with per-device INI configuration (`pim_config/`)
- Cluster-level configuration system (`cluster_config/*.json`) that consolidates all hardware,
  topology, and placement parameters into a single file
- Per-layer weight, KV cache, and expert placement rules in cluster config
- Additional latency metrics: ITL (Inter-Token Latency) and p99 for TTFT, TPOT, ITL
- Hardware performance profiles for TPU-v6e-1
- Batch experiment scripts for systematic evaluation (`script/`)
- Artifact evaluation scripts and reference results (`evaluation/`)
- `llm_profile` integrated as a local module with support for MoE models and power profiling

### Changed
- All hardware and topology parameters are now specified via `cluster_config` JSON files;
  per-invocation hardware arguments (`--model_name`, `--hardware`, `--npu_num`, etc.) are removed
- Command-line argument style changed from underscore to hyphen (e.g., `--cluster-config`,
  `--num-req`, `--block-size`)
- Dataset format changed from `.tsv` to `.jsonl`
- Build process consolidated into `./compile.sh` and `./docker.sh`
- Performance model directory relocated from `perf_model/` to `llm_profile/perf_models/`
- `inference_serving/` modules renamed for clarity:
  - `control.py` → `controller.py`
  - `generate_graph.py` → `graph_generator.py`
  - `generate_trace.py` → `trace_generator.py`
  - `config_generator.py` → `config_builder.py`
  - `pim.py` → `pim_model.py`
- Fix incorrect `evict_size` accumulation

### Removed
- `trace_test/` directory (superseded by `evaluation/` scripts)
- Direct per-invocation hardware arguments (`--model_name`, `--hardware`, `--npu_num`,
  `--npu_group`, `--npu_mem`, `--remote_bw`, `--link_bw`)

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-07-18

### Added
- `llm_profile` module with PyTorch Profiler for GPU layer and attention latency measurement
- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model support (replaces GPT-3 6.7B as the default model)
- Hugging Face model configuration support for easy addition of new models

### Changed
- Function names standardized to snake_case (e.g., `createNetworkConfig` → `create_network_config`,
  `calculateSizes` → `calculate_sizes`)
- Model configuration files updated to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct format

### Fixed
- Collective operation stall caused by unresolved dependencies in the ASTRA-Sim workload graph
- Network dimension calculation for full pipeline parallelism (`npus_per_dim` formula corrected)

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-06-04

### Changed
- ASTRA-Sim submodule updated to latest version (branch `v0.2.0`)
- Chakra updated to latest version
- Network configuration format changed from JSON to YAML
- `local_bw` and `remote_bw` parameters replaced with `link_latency`
- Conda environment dependencies updated and simplified

---

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-01-03

### Added
- GPU performance model based on TensorRT-LLM profiling (replaces NPU simulator)
- Auto config generator for network and memory configurations
- New parameters: `--hardware`, `--local_bw`, `--remote_bw`, `--link_bw`, `--fp`
- Additional metrics: `queuing_delay`, TTFT, TPOT
- Verbose logging option for detailed execution output

### Changed
- ASTRA-Sim submodule branch updated from `artifact` to `v0.1.0`

---

## [artifact] - 2024-06-23

### Added
- Initial project release as IISWC 2024 artifact: "LLMServingSim: A HW/SW Co-Simulation Infrastructure for LLM Inference Serving at Scale"
- NPU simulator-based co-simulation infrastructure (ASTRA-Sim + Polymath + codelets_src)
- Evaluation scripts and benchmark results
- Conda environment configuration (`environment.yml`)
